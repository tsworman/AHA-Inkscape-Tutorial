Vector art - nodes and paths between them

Closed shapes - Fill
Paths/Lines - Stroke
Handles let you shape a path and form the curve between nodes.


Most we'll do involves drawing (Pen tool) striaght lines and bezier curves (Shift+F6)

Draw an open shape and now click on the edit node tool. Notice how we can modify each point?

Shift click selects multiple nodes.
Ctrl+Alt+click to add more nodes.
Close our open end shape by joining selected nodes.
Undo that
Join the shape by adding a segment.


Change node types
- Corner
- Smooth
- Symetric
- Auto Smooth
- Make segments lines.

Lines and Curves are an object. 
Shapes and objects can be converted to a path. Lose ability to round corners/change node type or edit text.

Create a star and use the node tool. 
Convert the object start to a path and use the node tool.
We can also convert lines or strokes to paths and give use the ability to add fill.

Paths allow us to do boolean operations on shapes. Let's create two shapes and experiment.
Square and circle. See what happens when we raise and lower shapes and apply the same thing.


Align and distribute tools (ctrl+c/cntrl+v to paste and get a lot of objects.)
Double click something to get rotation


Test tool and put on path!


Guides (with snap to guides on)

Create line
Create points snapping to guides
Center on verticle axis.
Move center to bottom center
Ctrl+D to dup
rotate and repeat.
Select them all, group then path combine to get one object. We could laser engrave this.


Render

F++F++F
F=F-F++F-F
both angles to 60 and render.
